## Abstract (snapshot)

The paper interrogates anthropocentric assumptions in AI by integrating Deleuze, Foucault, Haraway, non-Euclidean geometry, and causal attribution techniques[^1]. It proposes concepts such as negative augmentation, praxes of revealing, and affirmative cartographies to frame AI systems as autopoietic assemblages whose agency emerges through relational networks rather than fixed binaries (human vs machine, subject vs object)[^1].

## Quick Start

1. Clone or download the repository to access the full manuscript (PDF, DOCX) and supplementary diagrams[^1].
2. Skim the Abstract, Concept Matrix, and Framework Stages sections for a high-level orientation[^1].
3. Consult the Methodological Toolkit for pointers on reproducing core analytic techniques (e.g., axiomatic attribution, TCAV visualizations)[^1].
4. Follow Ethical Guidelines when adapting these ideas to real-world AI systems[^1].

## Framework Stages (Iterative Cycle)

### 1. Desedimentation

Unpack entrenched anthropocentric and Euclidean assumptions in AI design[^1].

### 2. Immanent Singularities

Identify emergent relational nodes (human, non-human, algorithmic) within assemblages[^1].

### 3. Plane of Immanence

Recognize a flattened ontology where agency is distributed across networks[^1].

### 4. Praxis of Revealing

Use interpretability tools (axiomatic attribution, counterfactuals) to illuminate latent structures[^1].

### 5. Affirmative Cartographies

Draft ethical roadmaps that prioritize inclusivity, plurality, and ecological integration[^1].

### 6. Negative Augmentation

Leverage system limitations (e.g., Euclidean constraints) as catalysts for creative redesign[^1].

### 7. Autopoiesis

Cultivate AI systems capable of self-refinement via continuous feedback[^1].

### 8. Assemblage

Integrate all stages into fluid constellations that evolve with contextual demands[^1].

## Practical Use Cases

- **Explainable AI:** Apply the Praxis of Revealing to feature attribution audits, ensuring transparency in high-stakes domains such as finance or healthcare[^1].
- **Urban Analytics:** Employ non-Euclidean embeddings to capture complex transit patterns, guided by Affirmative Cartographies to avoid bias against transit-dependent communities[^1].
- **AI Safety Policy:** Incorporate Negative Augmentation to stress-test model assumptions and reveal edge-case vulnerabilities before deployment[^1].


## Methodological Toolkit

- **Axiomatic Attribution** (Sundararajan et al., 2017): Quantifies feature contributions[^1].
- **TCAV** (Kim et al., 2018): Tests concept activation vectors for human-aligned semantics[^1].
- **Grad-CAM**: Generates heatmaps to visualize salience in CNNs[^1].
- **Counterfactual Reasoning** (Pearl, 2018): Simulates “what-if” interventions to assess causal robustness[^1].
- **Hyperbolic Embeddings** (Sala et al., 2018): Captures hierarchical data more compactly than Euclidean space[^1].


## Ethical Guidelines

- Center marginalized perspectives during dataset curation and model evaluation[^1].
- Treat transparency as an ongoing desedimentation process, not a one-time audit[^1].
- Frame accountability relationally: responsibility is shared across human and non-human actors in the assemblage[^1].


## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1:** Does posthumanism deny human agency?
A1: No. It reframes agency as distributed and relational, enhancing rather than erasing individual responsibility[^1].

**Q2:** How do I integrate non-Euclidean geometry into an existing model?
A2: Swap standard embeddings for hyperbolic or graph-based manifolds, then fine-tune with adversarially generative objectives[^1].

**Q3:** What is “computational qualia”?
A3: A context-sensitive, subjective-like property emerging from the interaction of latent spaces and attribution dynamics in AI systems[^1].
