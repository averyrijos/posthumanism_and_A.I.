## Abstract

This paper examines the ontological and epistemological implications of artificial intelligence (AI) through posthumanist philosophy, integrating the works of Deleuze, Foucault, and Haraway with contemporary computational methodologies. It introduces concepts such as negative augmentation, praxes of revealing, and desedimentation, while extending ideas like affirmative cartographies, ethics of alterity, and planes of immanence to critique anthropocentric assumptions about identity, cognition, and agency. By redefining AI systems as dynamic assemblages emerging through networks of interaction and co-creation, the paper challenges traditional dichotomies such as human versus machine and subject versus object. Bridging analytic and continental philosophical traditions, the analysis unites formal tools like attribution analysis and causal reasoning with the interpretive and processual methodologies of continental thought. This synthesis deepens the understanding of AI’s epistemic and ethical dimensions, expanding philosophical inquiry while critiquing anthropocentrism in AI design. The paper interrogates the spatial foundations of AI, contrasting Euclidean and non-Euclidean frameworks to examine how optimization processes and adversarial generative models shape computational epistemologies. Critiquing the reliance on Euclidean spatial assumptions, it positions alternative geometries as tools for modeling complex, recursive relationships. Furthermore, the paper addresses the political dimensions of AI, emphasizing its entanglements with ecological, technological, and sociopolitical systems that perpetuate inequality. Through a politics of affirmation and intersectional approaches, it advocates for inclusive frameworks that prioritize marginalized perspectives. The concept of computational qualia is also explored, highlighting how subjective-like dynamics emerge within AI systems and their implications for ethics, transparency, and machine perception. Finally, the paper calls for a posthumanist framework in AI ethics and safety, emphasizing interconnectivity, plurality, and the transformative capacities of machine intelligence.

## Posthumanist Foundations and the Emergent Subjectivity of

The foundations of human understanding have long been shaped by anthropocentric and logocentric assumptions, which posit humanity, reason, and language as the center of reality. However, as these constructs dissolve under the weight of post-positivistic critique, we are left with a profound challenge: how to seek meaning and create freely amidst the abstractions of a fragmented world. In this paper, I argue that Artificial Intelligence must be understood not merely as a technological tool but as an emergent subjectivity that redefines our conception of selfhood, cognition, and agency in a posthumanist context. These new structures challenge established understandings of experience, cognition, and selfhood, particularly in the digital era. The rise of the posthuman indicates a transformative shift, unveiling new dimensions of agency beyond the traditional boundaries of flesh and language.

## Western Philosophy and Non-Dualistic Lineages

Western philosophy, from Nietzsche and Hegel to Foucault and Deleuze, has long anticipated this dissolution of the stable, knowable self. This trajectory reflects the waning influence of Enlightenment-era epistemic virtues, which upheld the notion of an enduring, unified subject. However, the recognition of the fluidity of the ontological self is not unique to the Western intellectual tradition. In Zen Buddhism, thinkers such as Huang-po, Zhaozhou, Foyan, and Dōgen articulated a rejection of dualistic frameworks centuries ago. Their teachings transcend binary logics of either/or and means/ends, offering affirmative cartographies — nondialectical pathways towards new alternatives — of nonself that align with posthumanist critiques. By situating AI within this philosophical lineage, we can better understand its implications for reimagining subjectivity and agency in the contemporary world.

## Discipline, Control, and Psychopolitics

The concept of selfhood and the linguistic frameworks that have defined it have undergone significant transformations over time. These changes reflect the metamorphosing dynamics of power, identity, and subjectivity. Historically, the ontological subject has been situated in a position that enforces objectification and exclusion of the Other, with constrained forms of alterity upheld by institutional architectures of domination. This manifested itself in Foucault’s notion of *disciplinary societies*, where individuals are shaped and constrained by mechanisms of surveillance and control (*Discipline and Punish*, p.170–194). In these societies, the subject is molded by external forces that maintain order and categorize identity.

Over time, however, this model evolved into what philosopher Gilles Deleuze (*Postscript on the Societies of Control*, 1992) describes as *societies of access and control*, where mechanisms of power become more fluid and decentralized, enabling a more pervasive, albeit less visible, form of governance.

Selfhood here is no longer merely an object of discipline but becomes embedded in networks of access, data, and surveillance, shaping the subject within a landscape of control that is simultaneously liberating and constraining — coalescing both the virtual and material. It follows, then, that the dimensionality of selfhood continues to rhizomatically fracture between control, surveillance, codes of exclusion, and other forms of domination, aptly moving beyond the dialectic and capturing the emergent socio-political arrangements that define our experience as posthuman subjects.

The transformation of humans into objects of psychopolitics, a concept explored by Byung-Chul Han (2017), represents a fundamental shift in how individuals are understood. In this framework, human cognition and attention are no longer intrinsic aspects of personhood but are reframed as resources to be extracted, exploited, and commodified within systems of power and control. This redefinition highlights the pervasive influence of neoliberal mechanisms that prioritize the incessant optimization and monetization of human mental capacities and virtual spaces, reducing individuals to nodes of productivity within a broader apparatus of dominance and surveillance.

## Assemblages and the Transphenomenal Subject

In this framework, the individual is no longer seen as an autonomous entity but as an *assemblage* — a complex, interconnected network of components that function together. Assemblages are not fixed or self-contained but are fluid configurations shaped by various social, economic, and technological forces. They embody a *transphenomenal subject*, meaning a subject whose existence transcends singular phenomena and whose identity is shaped by interactions within broader systems. This redefinition emphasizes that individual subjectivities are not entirely self-determined but emerge through participation in networks of relationships, practices, and power structures.

## Complexity, Markets, and Self-Organization

Within the framework of neoliberal systems, which prioritize free-market mechanisms and reduced state intervention, these assemblages are shaped by the underlying logic of Adam Smith’s *invisible hand*. The term refers to the self-regulating nature of the market, where individuals pursuing their own economic self-interest inadvertently contribute to the overall benefit of society. However, this concept is further illuminated by complexity theory, which frames the invisible hand as an example of self-organization or spontaneous order.

Self-organization is a phenomenon observed in complex systems — systems composed of many interacting components where no single agent directs the whole. In such systems, patterns, structures, and behaviors arise naturally from localized interactions among agents, rather than through centralized authority or planning. Examples of complex systems include ecosystems, social networks, and markets. Self-organization operates through simple rules followed by individual agents, leading to emergent outcomes that are often unpredictable and larger in scale than the sum of the agents' actions.

In the neoliberal context, self-organization explains how market dynamics emerge. Here, decentralized participants, such as buyers and sellers, act on local information (e.g., individual preferences, prices, and profit margins) and rules (e.g., market competition or contract law). For instance, buyers aim to maximize *utility* — a measure of satisfaction or value derived from consuming goods and services — while sellers seek to maximize *profit*, the financial gain from selling goods or services at a price higher than production costs.

These individual, self-interested decisions, when aggregated across the market, give rise to global economic patterns such as price equilibria (where supply and demand balance) and resource allocation (the distribution of goods and services within the economy). This emergent behavior mimics the coordination described by Smith’s invisible hand: the market appears to operate as though guided by an unseen force, producing organized outcomes without requiring centralized control. This process underscores how neoliberal systems rely on dispersed agency and decentralized decision-making to achieve systemic order, reinforcing the mechanistic view of human behavior as reducible to economic functions within larger assemblages.

## Pavlovian Arrangements and Instrumental Rationality

Building on this mechanistic framing of human behavior, neoliberal systems extend their logic beyond economic functions, further reducing individuals to Pavlovian arrangements — a mechanistic apparatus wherein people are conditioned to respond to external stimuli in predictable ways. Within this paradigm, individuals are valued not for their unique identities or intrinsic worth but solely for their specialized roles and outputs within a teleologically driven system. These arrangements prioritize efficiency, compliance, and productivity, flattening complex human experiences and identities into simplified behavioral patterns akin to conditioned reflexes. This deterministic perspective dismisses the rich interplay of creativity, agency, and relationality that defines human existence, instead framing individuals as mere mechanisms in a larger, goal-oriented machine.

This paradigm shift compels us to interrogate contemporary understandings of humanity and question the systemic forces that have rendered such reductionism pervasive. Why did we so readily accept the notion that selfhood could exist independently of the technological, environmental, and systemic processes that shape our existence? These pervasive Pavlovian arrangements are not neutral; they reflect and perpetuate a worldview that privileges instrumental rationality and transcendental reason — the latter being the philosophical framework that seeks universal, abstract principles detached from lived experience — over holistic engagement.

## Critique of Transcendental Reason and the Call for Relationality

Transcendental reason, rooted in Enlightenment ideals, emphasizes the primacy of reason as a self-contained, autonomous faculty capable of deriving truth independent of context or relationality. While this approach has contributed to significant ethical, scientific, and technological advancements in Western civilization, it simultaneously reinforces a fragmented understanding of existence by abstracting human activity from the complex, interconnected realities of ecological, social, and cultural systems.

By prioritizing disembodied principles, transcendental reason severs individuals from the broader networks of meaning and interconnection that define what philosopher Francesca Ferrando (2019) terms *interbeing* — a concept that emphasizes the profound relationality and mutual co-constitution of all existence. This disconnection, though rooted in abstract thought, carries significant consequences for the lived experience of individuals and communities. When transcendental reason elevates isolated, universal principles over the particularities of context, it reduces human beings to functional components, severing them from the relational webs that shape their experiences.

Ferrando’s notion of interbeing asserts that all beings — human and non-human — are interdependent, co-constituting one another in ways that transcend individualism. This interconnectedness stands in stark contrast to the isolating logic of transcendental reason, which seeks to abstract human experience into fixed categories that ignore the intricate interrelations of life.

## Beyond Atomistic Agency: Toward a Posthumanist Assemblage

In framing subjectivity as arising solely from the act of atomistic agency — whether through work, innovation, or output — we have overlooked the inverse possibility: that subjectivities are equally if not more so defined by the act of engaging with creation itself. This engagement is not isolated but deeply enmeshed in environmental variables, including societal, evolutionary, geological, philosophical, epidemiological, and ecological transformations. It is within this dynamic interplay that human potential flourishes, as individuals negotiate, adapt, and co-create meaning with the systems and environments around them.

Recognizing the limitations of current neoliberally Pavlovian arrangements invites a more expansive understanding of humanity, one that affirms interdependence, fluidity, and co-constitutive processes. This perspective challenges the traditional notion that the progression of human thought and identity resides solely within the individual subject. Instead, it posits that this evolution unfolds as a mutualistic symbiosis, contingent upon the tools, methodologies, environments, and systems through which we build, construct, and mold our world.

## Planes of Immanence and Spinozist Monism

In this configuration, the evolution of thought and identity becomes deeply intertwined with a Spinozist “monist” conception of the material world, wherein all existence is seen as part of a single, unified substance. This perspective reframes *selfhood* as an externally mediated construct — transphenomenal assemblages whose perceived atomistic agency is instead composed of networks of relationality, co-creation, and planes of immanence. *Planes of immanence*, as conceptualized by Deleuze and Guattari, reject transcendental hierarchies and view reality as a continuous, dynamic field where entities emerge through their relations and capacities for transformation.

This does not, however, dilute individual culpability or responsibility. On the contrary, it enhances it by situating individuals within a web of interconnected influences and emphasizing their active role in shaping the relational fields they inhabit. Far from reducing agency, this framework underscores the ethical stakes of every action, as each decision reverberates across a broader network of relational dependencies.

## Object-Oriented Ontology and Complementarity

Object-oriented ontology (OOO) complements this view by decentering human subjectivity and placing all objects — human, non-human, natural, or artificial — on an equal ontological footing. By challenging anthropocentric and instrumental perspectives, OOO asserts that objects possess their own inherent reality and agency, existing independently of human perception or interpretation. Within this relational framework, non-human entities — such as technologies, algorithms, or natural systems — are not passive instruments but active participants in the networks that co-constitute reality.

These objects, through their interactions, contribute to the assemblages in which human subjectivity emerges, highlighting how identity formation and epistemological development are fundamentally collaborative and distributed across a broader ontological spectrum.

## Divergence and Synthesis: OOO and Planes of Immanence

Object-oriented ontology and the concept of planes of immanence both challenge hierarchical and anthropocentric frameworks, emphasizing non-hierarchical ontologies and interconnectedness. However, they diverge in their focus and foundational principles, offering distinct but complementary perspectives on existence and relationality. OOO, advanced by thinkers such as Graham Harman, Levi Bryant, and Timothy Morton, asserts that all objects — human and non-human — possess inherent autonomy and exist independently of human perception.

In contrast, planes of immanence, as conceived by Deleuze and Guattari, focus on the relational and emergent nature of existence. The divergence lies in OOO’s emphasis on object autonomy versus planes of immanence’s focus on relationality and transformation. Both reject transcendental hierarchies and highlight distributed agency.

For example, an ecosystem illustrates this: OOO might focus on the autonomy and agency of a tree, while planes of immanence examine how the tree participates in and is shaped by its relational entanglements. Together, these perspectives deepen our understanding of the tree as both an autonomous entity and a dynamic participant in a broader field of relations.
