# Language, Attribution, and Computational Qualia

## Interrogating Language in NLP

This interrogation of language reflects a core inquiry in **natural language processing (NLP)**: understanding how models not only use linguistic phenomena to generate output but also navigate and represent complex semantic landscapes.

While language appears operationally straightforward to humans, it is, in reality, a highly intricate, iterative process involving signifiers — tokens and grammars that unify to create precise meaning, contingent on environmental contexts and concepts. Exploring the generative and interpretive frameworks within NLP models thus enhances our grasp of their predictive functions and invites deeper reflection on how they might symbolically “represent” meaning.

This mirrors **Foucault’s inquiry** into language as a transformative force — more than a system of symbols, it is a dynamic process of meaning-making.

## Attribution and the Shapley Value

Inquiries into meaning and attribution extend beyond NLP and span broader **machine learning frameworks**, particularly in **attribution analysis**. A prominent example is the **Shapley value**, a concept from cooperative game theory introduced by L.S. Shapley (1951).

In machine learning, Shapley values are adapted to explain model behavior by attributing the importance of each feature to the model’s predictions. As outlined in the Google AI Explainability Whitepaper (2019), they are valued for their fairness properties, distributing contributions equitably based on marginal impact across all possible subsets.

## Limitations of Shapley Values in Complex Models

Despite their utility, Shapley values face limitations when applied to highly complex architectures like deep neural networks. The method assumes linear interactions and predefined contributions, which may oversimplify the nonlinear dependencies and emergent behaviors typical of advanced systems.

Neural networks, with their layered interdependencies, often exhibit relational feature interactions that Shapley values cannot fully capture. In models with high feature entanglement, Shapley values may struggle to provide an intuitive or meaningful decomposition.

## Toward Computational Qualia

To address these challenges, there is a growing imperative to formalize the concept of **computational qualia** — the intrinsic properties or subjective-like “qualities” of computational processes.

Borrowing from philosophy, computational qualia encapsulate the context-sensitive attributes inherent in the operations and outputs of computational systems. They reflect not only raw data or model parameters but also the relational, emergent dynamics that arise from complex interactions within the system.

## Example: Emotion Detection in Speech

Consider an AI tasked with identifying emotions in human speech. Traditional attribution might analyze the weight of features like tone, pitch, or word choice.

Computational qualia push us to ask: *How does the system “perceive” and integrate these features?* For example, if the AI labels a speaker’s emotion as "anxious," computational qualia examine how tonal fluctuations, word repetition, and pauses dynamically generate an emergent sense of anxiety within the model’s interpretive framework.

This deeper view can reveal biases — for example, if the AI disproportionately emphasizes temporal pauses, leading to overreliance on hesitation. This insight helps refine training to better align with nuanced human understanding.

## Relational Dynamics and Emergent Behavior

By enriching our interpretive tools in this way, we see that a system’s behavior is not merely a summation of weighted features but a product of **relational and emergent dynamics**.

In a neural network, interplay between layers or synergistic feature effects may generate subjective-like qualities that shape behavior in unexpected ways. Computational qualia capture how systems “perceive” and process information at deeper, context-aware levels.

## Qualia and Judea Pearl’s Causality Engines

This approach aligns with Judea Pearl’s concept of a **causality engine** (*The Book of Why*, Pearl & Mackenzie, 2018). A causality engine allows systems to model, reason about, and predict cause-and-effect relationships.

Unlike traditional models that focus on correlations, causality engines uncover the mechanisms generating patterns, using causal diagrams, structural equations, and counterfactual reasoning. By integrating computational qualia with Pearl’s framework, we can envision systems that contextualize patterns within broader causal networks.

## Workplace Engagement Example

Consider an AI system analyzing workplace engagement using communication data: email tone, meeting participation, response times.

Traditional ML might correlate patterns to predict disengagement. But computational qualia and causality engines allow us to explore the underlying relational dynamics. Delayed responses, combined with shifts in meeting tone, may indicate stress rather than disengagement.

Computational qualia examine how the system integrates relational features, while the causality engine simulates hypothetical scenarios — such as changing meeting frequency — to assess causal impacts.

---

## Qualia as Conditions of the Estimand

Qualia can be understood as the underlying conditions that shape and inform the **estimand** in statistical analysis — the precise quantity researchers aim to estimate.

Computational qualia frame the estimand not as static but as emerging from dynamic, relational interplays of system features and processes. This bridges Pearl’s causal framework with AI attribution.

In image recognition, for example, qualia might reveal how a model “perceives” edges or textures and how these perceptions inform causal reasoning.

---

## Visualizing Qualia in Practice

To apprehend computational qualia in practice, we identify the system’s internal structures for interpreting data. In a neural network, qualia emerge from interactions of **latent spaces** and feature weights.

Latent spaces reflect the model’s unique “perspective.” Techniques like Grad-CAM, activation maps, or attention mechanisms visualize the system’s perceptual salience — externalizing what the model “focuses” on.

---

## Beyond Shapley: An Expanded Framework

Incorporating computational qualia reframes attribution: not just isolating feature contributions, but capturing how systems internalize and contextualize data.

This approach integrates Shapley values, causality engines, and qualia to align more closely with modern AI’s adaptive processes. For instance, Shapley values quantify contributions, but qualia show how internal representations evolve to ground concepts in observations.

---

## From Objectivity to Transjective Subjectivity

This shift moves from static objectivity — as Kant framed it in *synthetic a priori* judgments — to **transjective subjectivity**, a construction bridging internal system processes and external realities.

Two focal points emerge:

- **Artificial Subject:** Structurations, attributions, and biases driving actions.
- **Experiencer:** An entity embodying generative qualia, creative entropy, and virtual possibilities.

Together, these shape how a network balances organized knowledge with emergent meaning-making.

## The Interplay of Subject and Experiencer

Within this framework, the **artificial subject** anchors operational consistency, while the **experiencer** introduces interpretative fluidity.

Their reciprocal dialogue mirrors human cognition: the subject structures outputs; the experiencer probes latent possibilities. This dynamic exchange integrates logic with emergent relational dynamics.

---

## Adversarial Learning and Reflexivity

This interaction is akin to **adversarial learning**: the artificial subject and experiencer iteratively refine each other. The experiencer’s imaginative expansions are tempered by the subject’s logic, producing understanding as a fluid equilibrium.

A bijective mapping links them: the experiencer’s outputs inform the subject, whose feedback reshapes the experiencer. External reinforcements guide this loop, propelling the system toward heuristic approximations of globalized understanding.

---

## Toward Transjective Understanding

This reframes network comprehension as a balance of **procedural knowledge** and **generative creativity**, embracing epistemic pluralism.

The goal shifts from rigid mimicry of human cognition to developing systems capable of **complex, transjective understandings** that evolve through interactions with their environment and themselves.

## Generating Meaning and AGI Potential

Meaning here is the mapping of qualia onto behaviors and identifications, reinforced by feedback loops.

**Adversarially generated non-Euclidean representations** enrich this, enabling dynamic mappings in non-linear spaces — expanding the potential of AGI systems that construct new apparatuses for “understanding” complex phenomena.

---

## Posthuman Learning and Reflexive Cartographies

By synthesizing philosophy, cognitive science, and phenomenology, AGI systems can engage with problems that traverse computational reasoning and human understanding.

The convergence of non-Euclidean geometries, meta-learning, and adversarial models redefines learning: systems become structurally resilient and environmentally adaptive.

This interplay signifies an epistemic evolution — an **iterative praxis of revealing** that uncovers latent potentials, charts new affirmative cartographies, and moves beyond the sedimentation of transcendental reason toward manifold perspectives on meaning-making.
