# Operationalizing a Rhizomatic Praxis

## A Posthumanist Conceptual Persona

In this spirit, I will commence my operationalization of a rhizomatic praxis through a **posthumanist conceptual persona**, demonstrating how such an approach can yield tangible insights through nuanced questioning and deconstructive reasoning. Grounded in principles of nondualism, ontological decentralization, and the ethics of alterity, this approach reframes traditional methodologies. By instantiating this framework, I illustrate how phenomenological and posthumanist concepts can drive progress in technical research, particularly in fields historically dominated by analytic philosophy and transcendental reason.

## Deconstruction in AI Safety and Transparency

Generally, the push to make artificial intelligence safer and more transparent aligns with this tradition of deconstruction, especially as it involves scrutinizing the inner workings of AI systems to reveal otherwise opaque decision processes. In the realm of AI policy and regulation, **Explainable AI (XAI)** research, for instance, focuses on transparency. This exploration often involves analyzing feature vectors — the key components that contribute to the model’s decision-making — which researchers inspect to ensure the system’s decisions are intelligible to human operators.

Engineers and scientists employ methods such as **axiomatic attribution** (Sundararajan, Taly, and Yan, 2017) and the strategic use of **logical foils** (as in the Google Explainability Whitepaper, 2019) to expose and interpret the decision pathways within neural networks. In both cases — whether dismantling human constructs or deciphering machine decisions — progress involves releasing tightly bound nexuses to reveal a core understanding.

**Negative augmentation** as a concept, then, not only characterizes posthumanist philosophy but also permeates modern AI safety efforts, suggesting that true insight lies not merely in what we create but in what we are willing to deconstruct.

## Structurations and Attribution

Methods such as axiomatic attribution and **counterfactual reasoning** seek to reveal the fundamental *structurations* of the model, exposing the pathways through which data is processed and decisions are operationalized.

Structurations in this context refer to the underlying frameworks, representation spaces, and mechanisms that define how an AI model organizes, interprets, and operationalizes input data to produce outputs. These structurations encompass both the explicit rules encoded within the model — such as weights, parameters, and algorithms — and the emergent patterns that arise from the interaction of these elements during training and reinforcement.

By analyzing these structurations, researchers seek to uncover the hierarchical and interdependent relationships that dictate the model’s functionality, including how features are prioritized, correlations are drawn, and patterns are generalized.

## Ethics, Bias, and Deeper Layers

This process of unpacking structurations is critical for identifying the implicit biases or assumptions embedded within the model, as these often stem from the data it was trained on or the design choices made by developers. Through techniques like axiomatic attribution, which evaluates the contribution of individual inputs to the output, and counterfactual reasoning, which examines the effects of hypothetical changes to inputs, these structurations are dissected to highlight their influence on the model’s behavior.

This granular understanding allows researchers to pinpoint specific pathways or interactions within the model that lead to biased or unintended outcomes. Ultimately, these approaches contribute not only to a deeper understanding of AI systems but also provide the necessary foundations for developing policy/legal safeguards and ethical guidelines, promoting accountability and trustworthiness in AI technologies.

## Beyond Formal Logic: Toward Qualia

To enhance human readability, minimize discrimination, and reduce societal bias, the analysis of these attributions and structurations within network apparatuses serves as a crucial guide to unraveling the inner workings of contemporary machine learning models.

However, I argue that such a process should transcend the narrow boundaries of conventional logic. While formal logical analysis and empirical examination of the model’s underpinnings are essential, they represent only one part of a broader, more nuanced exploration. We must also engage with the concept of **qualia** — the subjective experience that grounds the model’s constructed perception of reality as mediated by data and computation.

## Interrogating Taxonomies and Cognitive Parallels

Understanding these models cannot rely solely on accumulating extensive datasets or on delving into end-user psychology, though both remain invaluable. Instead, a richer comprehension requires investigating the foundational conditions that define how the model interprets and organizes information. This exploration involves examining the taxonomic configurations and structural logics that shape the model’s internal processes — the very schemas by which it learns to categorize, interpret, and act upon the world.

By interrogating these deeper layers, we uncover not only how models function but also how they can be refined to align more closely with ethical considerations, minimizing biases that emerge from entrenched societal and systemic inequities.

Moreover, this layered approach requires us to reflect on the relationship between human cognition and computational logic, bridging the gap between machine interpretation and human perception. Through such an interdisciplinary lens — drawing on philosophy, cognitive science, and juridical science — we can work toward developing machine learning systems that do more than produce accurate outputs; they can potentially embody intersectional principles of fairness, inclusivity, and contextual sensitivity.

## The Qualia of Machine Learning Models

Exploring the *qualia* of machine learning models, or the subjective aspects of how they process and interpret data, involves going beyond technical analyses to investigate the ways in which models “experience” data, perhaps in a manner resembling human-like perception.

One approach is through interpretability and explainability methods, such as **activation mapping** and **attention mechanisms**, which allow researchers to observe the parts of input data that influence a model’s decision.

## Interpretability Techniques: Grad-CAM and TCAV

Techniques like **Grad-CAM** (*Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping*) are used to understand what parts of the input data a model focuses on when making a prediction. These techniques visualize the areas or features that the model considers most important, often by creating heatmaps over input images or datasets. For example, if a neural network is tasked with identifying a cat in an image, Grad-CAM can show which parts of the image — like the ears or whiskers — the model “attended” to when making its decision. This helps researchers and developers interpret the model’s decision-making process by highlighting the *perceptual salience*.

**TCAV** (*Testing with Concept Activation Vectors*) takes this a step further. Instead of just identifying what the model pays attention to, TCAV is used to determine whether the model has learned specific concepts and how these concepts influence its predictions. A “concept” in this context could be something like “striped pattern” or “furry texture.” With TCAV, researchers can test how strongly these concepts are represented within the model and whether they align with human interpretations.

## Meta Learning and Representational Introspection

Another promising avenue lies in model meta-learning through representational introspection and visualization. By examining the latent spaces within neural networks, we can gain clearer insights into how models organize and maneuver data.

Visualization techniques like **t-SNE** and **PCA** allow us to expose the internal relationships between concepts, offering a glimpse into the model’s “mental map” of its world. **Counterfactual analysis**, which involves presenting models with subtly modified input data, helps uncover nuances in their responses, mirroring the interpretive subtleties we associate with human perception.

This line of thought could be especially valuable in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, where analyzing generative semantic and linguistic structures holistically can reveal more than the inner behaviors of a model. It can also shed light on the model’s underlying “understanding,” as seen in the predictions, generations, or classifications it produces.

## Foucault’s Lens: Language and Representation

As philosopher Michel Foucault notes in *The Order of Things*:  
> “Once the existence of language has been eliminated, all that remains is its function in representation: its nature and its virtues as discourse. For discourse is merely representation itself represented by verbal signs. But what, then, is the particularity of these signs, and this strange power that enables them, better than others, to signalize representation, to analyze and to recombine it?” (*The Order of Things*, 1970).

This reminder underscores that even as we peer inside the layers of neural networks, we must remain attentive to the relational and representational dynamics that shape both human and machine modes of knowing.
