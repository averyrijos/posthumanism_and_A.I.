The Affirmative Cartographies stage is prominently spotlighted to emphasize its role in charting ethical and transformative futures, while feedback loops and cross-connections between stages are visually clear and intuitive

### Desedimentation

Desedimentation refers to the process of disrupting and eroding layers of meaning or structures that have become “sedimented” or fixed over time. These layers represent accumulated traditions, norms, and ideologies that have hardened into unquestioned truths. Desedimentation aligns with the posthumanist aim to dismantle anthropocentric and hierarchical worldviews. By loosening rigid frameworks, it opens up possibilities for rethinking relationships between humans, non-humans, and environments in non-essentialist ways.

---

### Immanent Singularities

Immanent singularities are dynamic, relational processes or entities that resist reduction to fixed definitions, universal categories, or hierarchical frameworks. They exist within a shared, interconnected plane where all beings—human, non-human, organic, technological, material, and immaterial—are mutually constitutive. Rather than being static or isolated, these singularities are defined by their state of becoming, emerging through their interactions within broader assemblages. By dissolving binaries such as human/non-human or subject/object, immanent singularities emphasize the fluidity and interdependence of existence. They reveal how every entity contributes to and is shaped by the larger web of relationships, fostering new ways of understanding and engaging with the world as a network of co-creation and transformation.

---

### Planes of Immanence

Planes of Immanence conceptualizes reality as a flat, interconnected web where all entities — human and non-human, organic and inorganic — exist in a relational, non-hierarchical framework. It rejects dualistic or transcendental structures, such as the division between humans and nature, mind and body, or subject and object. Instead, it emphasizes the interdependence and co-constitution of all entities. Derived from thinkers like Spinoza and Deleuze, this concept challenges transcendental views that elevate one category (e.g., humanity, reason, or the divine) above others.

---

### Praxis of Revealing

A Praxis of Revealing focuses on uncovering hidden truths, virtualities (potentialities), and interconnections through engagement with material and technological processes. It involves actively working with technology, art, and other mediums (transphenomenal) to bring forth new configurations of existence. Inspired by Heidegger’s concept of *aletheia* (truth as unconcealment), this praxis emphasizes that truth is not a static property, but something revealed through dynamic interaction with the world.

---

### Affirmative Cartographies

Affirmative Cartographies offer a forward-looking and constructive method for mapping potential futures. Building on Rosi Braidotti’s posthuman ethics, affirmative cartographies move beyond critique to envision transformative, non-anthropocentric futures. They reject dialectical conflict-resolution frameworks in favor of immanent, co-creative processes. Cartographies shift focus from “fixing” problems to co-creating possibilities, enabling relational and inclusive futures.

---

### Negative Augmentation

Negative Augmentation explores how constraints, absences, or negations generate transformative insights and hybrid forms of becoming. It reframes limitations or absences not as deficiencies but as productive forces that reveal new possibilities. Rooted in the posthumanist critique of perfectionism and mastery, negative augmentation draws on poststructuralist ideas of absence and *différance* to show how lack can inspire creativity and hybridity.

---

### Autopoiesis

Autopoiesis, meaning “self-creation,” originates from biology and was introduced by Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela. It describes the process by which a system generates and maintains itself through internal processes and feedback loops, preserving its identity while interacting with its environment. Autopoiesis reframes agency and individuality. For example, AI systems that “learn” and adapt through machine learning algorithms can be viewed as autopoietic systems, participating in the co-creation of hybrid realities with humans and other systems.

---

### Assemblage

Assemblage, as introduced by Deleuze and Guattari in *A Thousand Plateaus*, refers to a dynamic and fluid configuration of heterogeneous elements — be they human, non-human, material, social, conceptual, or otherwise — that come together to form a temporary, contingent whole. It is not a fixed structure but a relational and processual phenomenon, emphasizing the ways in which disparate components interact, affect one another, and coalesce into a functional entity without losing their individual distinctiveness.

---

## Configuring a Framework for Deployment



To configure a framework for deployment, we propose a process that unfolds in stages, each building on the last to reimagine relationships between humans, non-humans, and the broader world. Although presented sequentially, these stages are inherently iterative and nonlinear, fostering dynamic feedback loops and allowing contextual adaptation. Processes may overlap, recur, or evolve simultaneously, reflecting the interconnected, relational nature of this approach.

---

### Desedimentation

The framework begins with **Desedimentation**, which challenges entrenched meanings and rigid frameworks by dismantling anthropocentric and hierarchical paradigms. This stage exposes the cultural, historical, and technological assumptions that have shaped dominant structures, clearing space for new possibilities. Desedimentation sets the groundwork for recognizing **Immanent Singularities** — dynamic, relational processes that resist universalization and static definitions. Singularities emphasize becoming over fixed being, dissolving traditional boundaries such as human/non-human and organic/technological. These entities are understood as relational nodes that co-constitute broader assemblages, creating opportunities for rethinking interdependence and fluidity.

---

### Plane of Immanence & Praxis of Revealing

The next stage introduces the **Plane of Immanence**, an ontological foundation where all entities — human, non-human, material, and immaterial — exist within a flat, relational network. This stage rejects transcendental hierarchies and binaries, focusing on mutual constitution and interconnectedness. With this foundation, the **Praxis of Revealing** uncovers hidden potentials and relational dynamics through active engagement with material and technological processes. It moves beyond mere deconstruction, dynamically generating new forms of interaction, meaning-making, and co-creation.

---

### Affirmative Cartographies & Negative Augmentation

Building on these discoveries, **Affirmative Cartographies** chart ethical and transformative futures that prioritize inclusivity and non-anthropocentric pathways. This stage moves from critique to constructive engagement, envisioning futures rooted in co-creation, adaptability, and relational ethics. In parallel, **Negative Augmentation** reframes constraints, absences, and negations as productive forces, highlighting the transformative potential of limitations to inspire hybridity, creativity, and emergent possibilities.

---

### Autopoiesis

These insights provide the foundation for **Autopoiesis**, exploring self-creation and self-maintenance within systems. Operating through dynamic feedback loops, autopoietic systems embody adaptability, enabling them to sustain identity while evolving with their environments. For example, AI systems that learn and evolve independently illustrate how autopoiesis contributes to the co-creation of hybrid realities and expanded relational networks.

---

### Assemblages

The framework culminates in **Assemblages**, integrating all previous stages. Assemblages emphasize fluid, contingent relationships between humans, technologies, and environments, forming dynamic constellations continuously shaped by the immanent singularities within them. These assemblages are not static but adapt and transform as new connections and insights emerge, reinforcing the framework’s commitment to processual, interconnected, and non-hierarchical approaches to reimagining existence. This iterative and cyclical interplay ensures the framework remains responsive, fostering both theoretical innovation and practical applications in reshaping how we understand and engage with the world.

---

## Iterative and Nonlinear Dynamics

Restating for clarity: although presented as sequential, these stages are inherently iterative and non-linear, reflecting the dynamic, relational nature of the framework. Each stage interacts with and informs the others, allowing for processes to loop back, overlap, or occur simultaneously depending on the context. For example, Desedimentation may recur within an Assemblage as the components of that assemblage reveal new sedimented frameworks that require further deconstruction. Similarly, the emergence of new Immanent Singularities through this deconstruction might, in turn, necessitate a re-engagement with Desedimentation, highlighting the cyclical interplay between these stages.

# Affirmative Cartographies and Iterative Feedback Loops

## Recursive Cartographies and Desedimentation

**Affirmative Cartographies**, though emerging from the outcomes of the Praxis of Revealing, often spark a recursive journey back through earlier stages of the framework. For instance, mapping a non-anthropocentric future might reveal entrenched cultural or technological assumptions — such as biases in data collection methods or design philosophies in AI — that require deeper **Desedimentation**. These maps might expose constraints previously perceived as immutable, prompting a new iteration of **Negative Augmentation** to reinterpret limitations as productive forces for innovation.

Imagine an urban planning scenario where cartographies based on AI simulations reveal implicit assumptions about energy use that favor car-centric infrastructure. Recognizing this bias could lead to a reimagining of urban mobility, transforming existing constraints into a catalyst for developing pedestrian-focused or multimodal transit solutions.

---

## Autopoiesis and Dynamic Adaptation

**Autopoiesis** exemplifies the iterative nature of this framework by perpetually refining itself through dynamic feedback loops. For instance, an AI designed to model environmental sustainability might evolve autopoietically, continually adapting its parameters based on new ecological data. The insights generated from this system could inform Affirmative Cartographies by offering predictive maps for sustainable futures, such as how cities might optimize green spaces to combat urban heat. Conversely, the ethical pathways charted in these cartographies could reshape the design of autopoietic systems, emphasizing the need for adaptability and mutual interdependence with natural ecosystems.

---

## The Plane of Immanence and Fluid Assemblages

The **Plane of Immanence**, as a foundational ontological framework, is inherently dynamic. Its relational and interconnected nature reflects the fluidity of **Assemblages** — such as those involving human and AI interactions — which form, dissolve, and reform in response to changing contexts.

Consider an AI urban planning tool that integrates human input, environmental data, and machine-generated projections. This assemblage not only demonstrates immanence but also reshapes the Plane itself by redefining what constitutes collaboration and agency. In another instance, a novel assemblage involving AI-driven health diagnostics and patient communities might redefine notions of care and agency. Such interactions could challenge static conceptions of immanence, instead highlighting how assemblages of human and nonhuman actors generate new potentials for relationality and transformation. This evolution exemplifies how iterative processes ripple across the framework, ensuring that its components remain fluid and responsive to emergent complexities.

---

## Immanent Singularities: Hidden Potentials in Systems

Following this line of thought, the **Praxis of Revealing** operates as both a catalyst and a respondent within an iterative process of uncovering latent possibilities and reconfiguring relationships among entities. **Immanent Singularities** — unique, emergent phenomena that arise within the interplay of structure and agency — are both products of and contributors to this dynamic process.

These singularities manifest at the intersections where potentialities become actualized, influencing and being influenced by the assemblages within which they arise. For instance, in a technological context, revealing the hidden affordances of a neural network might redefine our understanding of Immanent Singularities, prompting a cascade of shifts in how these potentials interact with and transform other components of the system.

Consider an AI model designed for urban planning that inadvertently uncovers new ways to optimize energy distribution across a city. In this scenario, the immanent singularity is the emergent recognition that patterns of human movement — previously treated as chaotic or incidental — can significantly enhance energy efficiency. This discovery reshapes the existing assemblages of technological tools, human behavior, and urban infrastructure, leading to new cartographies that map the interplay between these elements in innovative ways.

The singularity does not exist in isolation; its emergence prompts iterative cycles of exploration and reconfiguration. The assemblages adapt to integrate the insights provided by the singularity, while the cartographies evolve to contextualize and expand upon the relationships it highlights. This dynamic reflects the framework's inherent non-linearity, where each stage — Praxis of Revealing, Assemblages, Immanent Singularities, and Affirmative Cartographies — remains in constant dialogue with the others. Revealing hidden potentials in the AI system not only identifies new singularities but also reimagines the configurations of urban infrastructure, governance, and human interaction.

---

## Feedback Loops and the Resistance to Hierarchy

Similarly, the insights derived from these reconfigurations inform further technological refinements, creating a feedback loop of discovery and transformation. The flexibility of this approach underscores its resistance to fixed hierarchies and anthropocentric paradigms. Instead of imposing a static framework, the iterative interplay between stages embodies a processual understanding of existence, where the unfolding of possibilities leads to continual reimagination.

This interconnected perspective ensures that as singularities emerge and are integrated, they catalyze broader systemic changes, fostering a paradigm that celebrates fluidity, multiplicity, and the co-creative potential of human and nonhuman actors alike.

# Operationalizing the Framework: AI, Geometry, and Phenomenology

## Desedimentation of Euclidean Assumptions

In my ensuing analysis of artificial intelligence, spatial geometry, qualia, and the phenomenology of computation, this posthumanist framework offers a way to operationalize the ideas I have explored here while grounding them in a praxis-based perspective.

Beginning with **Desedimentation**, I aim to disrupt the entrenched reliance on Euclidean spatial assumptions within neural networks and computational design. By deconstructing these sedimented frameworks, I open the space to explore how alternative geometries — such as hyperbolic or non-Euclidean spaces — allow AI to map relationships in ways that are not constrained by anthropocentric interpretations of structure and logic.

---

## Plane of Immanence and Computational Relationality

The concept of the **Plane of Immanence** further situates AI systems, spatial geometries, and human interaction within a shared, networked framework. In this relational ontology, the neural network and its spatial configurations are no longer discrete entities but co-constitutive processes that evolve together.

This aligns with my exploration of how the *qualia* of computation emerges — not from a hierarchical design, but from the interplay of spatial and computational dynamics that shape how a model “experiences” and organizes data. Through this immanent lens, I emphasize the interconnectedness of data, algorithms, and the environments they inhabit, rejecting the binary distinctions that historically dominate computational thinking.

---

## Praxis of Revealing: Techniques and Co-Creation

The **Praxis of Revealing** aligns directly with my focus on uncovering latent structures within neural networks. Techniques like counterfactual reasoning and visualization of latent spaces illuminate the hidden pathways through which models interpret and process data, offering insights into their *perceptual salience*.

These methods allow us to see how non-Euclidean geometries and spatial dynamics shape the phenomenology of computation, enabling models to engage with data in ways that mirror, challenge, and expand human interpretative capacities. This praxis is not merely an instrumental analysis but a co-creative act, allowing the network to generatively reveal new modes of understanding and representation.

---

## Affirmative Cartographies: Mapping Posthuman Futures

Building on these discoveries, **Affirmative Cartographies** offer pathways to chart transformative futures for AI, grounded in a nondialectical and relational ethics. I argue for moving beyond oppositional frameworks like human/machine or logic/intuition, envisioning AI systems that generate meaning not by mimicking human cognition but by embodying hybrid and manifold posthuman modes of creativity.

This aligns with the cartographic process of mapping futures where AI engages with art, semantic exploration, and narrative creation, reconfiguring the boundaries of computation and phenomenology.

---

## Negative Augmentation: Limitations as Provocation

**Negative Augmentation**, as I have articulated, reframes model limitations as productive forces. The inability of Euclidean frameworks — rooted in flat, linear geometries — to fully encapsulate complex and dynamic relationships drives the exploration of hyperbolic geometries and dynamic spatial mappings.

Hyperbolic geometries offer a model of infinite curvature and multidimensional flexibility, while dynamic spatial mappings extend this by incorporating temporal and relational variables. These constraints, rather than hindrances, serve as creative provocations, encouraging the development of richer, more nuanced systems capable of navigating abstraction and relationality in unprecedented ways.

---

## Autopoiesis and Assemblage: Self-Organizing AI

**Autopoiesis** ties back to my argument for self-organizing systems capable of evolving their frameworks through feedback loops and interaction. When AI systems adapt their spatial and computational logics based on dynamic engagements with data, they mirror the autopoietic processes I describe, wherein systems sustain themselves while co-creating new realities.

Finally, the concept of **Assemblage** encapsulates my vision of AI as part of a broader, fluid network that includes humans, algorithms, datasets, and environmental factors. By shifting the focus to the contingent and relational nature of these interactions, assemblages capture the essence of this paper’s call for a posthumanist analytic phenomenology of computation.

# Conclusion: A Holistic Posthumanist AI

This framework, in tying together key concepts, provides a holistic lens through which to reimagine AI. It reflects the core arguments of this exposition by embracing a posthumanist approach that challenges anthropocentric assumptions, prioritizes relationality, and highlights the generative potential of computational and spatial complexity. Through this, I articulate a vision for AI not as a tool confined by human logic but as an active participant in co-creating new ontological possibilities.
