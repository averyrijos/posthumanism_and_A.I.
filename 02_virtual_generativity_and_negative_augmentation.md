# Virtual Generativity and Negative Augmentation

A plane of immanence serves as a conceptual foundation where thought, existence, and reality are understood as interconnected and relational, free from hierarchical or transcendental structures. Unlike frameworks that impose universal truths or external organizing forces, the plane of immanence emphasizes that meaning emerges dynamically through the self-generative processes of life, often described as autopoietic, or self-sustaining. This perspective reframes identity and agency as fluid and co-constituted, rejecting static Paramedian binaries in favor of processual Heraclitean relationalities and transformations. Within these planes, distinctions between individual and collective, subject and object dissolve, as each continually influences and redefines the other. They represent spaces of manifold potential, where ideas, identities, and systems arise as co-creative processes shaped by relational dynamics rather than any singular essence or predetermined trajectory.

The concept of *autopoiesis*, introduced in the early 1970s by Chilean biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, describes the self-sustaining nature of living systems. An autopoietic system is organized as a network of processes that produce components which, through their interactions, regenerate and sustain the network itself. This dynamic organization constitutes the system as a concrete unity in space, perpetually recreating its own existence. Planes of immanence extend this concept by emphasizing the interplay between the actual (what exists) and the virtual (latent potentials or possibilities) in the continual generation of novel forms and meanings. These planes highlight how identity and thought are not isolated phenomena but ongoing negotiations within assemblies of populations, external systems, and artifacts. By reframing thought as a distributed phenomenon — not confined to individual minds but flowing through nature, culture, technology, and shared experiences — planes of immanence challenge traditional notions of subjectivity and individuality. This shift subsequently invites the praxis of revealing: a deliberate process of uncovering latent potentials within interconnected networks to illuminate co-creative possibilities for meaning-making.

For example, consider the development of renewable energy systems like smart grids. These systems operate autopoietically, constantly balancing supply and demand through networks of sensors, algorithms, and user inputs. Virtualities manifest as the latent potential to harness previously unconnected energy sources or optimize grid efficiency through novel configurations of technology and policy. Planes of immanence frame this process by emphasizing the relational interplay of human actors, technological infrastructures, and environmental contexts. The praxis of revealing might involve uncovering the latent possibilities in decentralized energy production, such as enabling remote communities to generate power locally while contributing to the larger grid. This approach transforms the grid into a co-creative assemblage that dynamically adapts to new challenges and possibilities, highlighting how virtualities can be realized through relational practices embedded in broader systems.

# The Praxis of Revealing: A Posthumanist Transformative Process

## Revealing as Transformative Praxis

The **praxis of revealing** functions as a transformative process, not as an additional layer imposed onto the concept of the subject, but as a reframing of perceived lack into opportunity. By peeling away the sedimented layers of human perspectival limitations, it exposes the historically contingent structures and assumptions that have shaped corporeal existence and sensory experience over millennia. This practice aligns with posthumanist critiques, challenging the notion of a stable, autonomous, atomistic self and revealing the "core identity" as a construct shaped by centuries of cultural, technological, and philosophical influences.

This deconstructive endeavor echoes the Buddhist concept of *Śūnyatā*, or emptiness, which recognizes that beneath the constructed layers of identity lies a void — free from inherent essence or fixity. Far from being a negation, this emptiness is a site of potentiality and transformation, an opening through which identity can be reimagined. It invites a fluid and relational mode of existence, emphasizing the ways in which selfhood is co-constituted through its entanglements with artifacts, systems, and networks.

## Critiques from Analytic Traditions

Thinkers and philosophers steeped in the analytical tradition of logic and science might critique the praxis of revealing and posthumanist phenomenology as overly abstract, arguing that its emphasis on relationality, fluidity, and nomadic actualization lacks empirical grounding or precise definitional clarity. They could challenge whether concepts like *affirmative cartographies* and *nomadic actualization* offer tangible contributions to understanding identity, or if they merely obfuscate it with metaphorical language.

Moreover, they might question the utility of reframing identity through a posthumanist lens, claiming it risks undermining actionable agency by dissolving the self into a web of relations, potentially making ethical accountability diffuse or incoherent.

## In Defense: An Expanded Ontology

In defense, the praxis of revealing is not an abandonment of empirical rigor or agency but an expansion of the frameworks within which identity and reality are understood. Its metaphorical language is not obfuscation but an intentional means of articulating the complexity and dynamism of identity that traditional, reductionist paradigms fail to capture.

Concepts such as *affirmative cartographies* and *nomadic actualization* are artifacts for reimagining identity as an emergent process within interconnected systems, thereby fostering a more inclusive and adaptable understanding of minoritarian perspectives. Furthermore, far from diffusing agency, this approach enhances it by situating individuals within relational fields where their actions gain greater significance through transformative impacts on broader networks. Ethical accountability becomes more robust in this model because it recognizes the distributed nature of influence and the necessity of reflexivity in navigating complex interdependencies.

## Affirmative Cartographies: Actionable Frameworks

The **Praxis of Revealing** uncovers latent dimensions within identity and technology, which *Affirmative Cartographies* translate into actionable frameworks for reimagining the future. These cartographies reject static binaries and hegemonic frameworks, instead embracing difference and plurality while dynamically responding to the interplay of ideas, experiences, and contexts.

For example, when mapping a non-anthropocentric future, one might identify hidden cultural or technological assumptions that, once desedimented, enable the actualization of alternative ethical landscapes. Through the nomadic actualization of the virtual, the praxis uncovers unrealized potentials — immanent possibilities within identity, language, and culture that have been buried beneath historical and ideological sedimentation. By unveiling these latent dimensions, the praxis not only reimagines selfhood as an open, relational, and ever-becoming process but also positions posthumanism as a process of *desedimentation*.

## Desedimentation and Recursive Ecosystems

In practice, **desedimentation** involves an undoing of static, sedimented, or entrenched perspectives that obfuscate meaning, laying the foundation for a more fluid and dynamic conception of existence. This perspective foregrounds relationships and interconnections, encouraging an understanding of the self as not only impermanent but also as part of larger, recursive systems — ecological, technological, and social.

These recursive ecosystems operate through feedback loops that connect the micro-level actions of individual components to the macro-level dynamics of the system. For example, in natural ecosystems, the behaviors of individual organisms — such as pollination by bees or nutrient cycling by fungi — affect the larger environment, which in turn influences those individual behaviors, creating a cyclical pattern of interdependence.

This same principle applies to human systems, where technological tools, cultural artifacts, and social structures recursively shape human behavior and thought, which then feed back into the system to modify those same tools and structures.

## Negative Augmentation: A Politics of Affirmation

This is the process I seek to understand as an object of history — a concept I denote here as **negative augmentation**, which explores how identities and meanings are not merely deconstructed but reshaped through alternative, non-dialectical processes. Negative augmentation captures the ways in which poststructuralist, postpositivist thought resists traditional binaries, opting instead for a fluid and expansive understanding of identity.

Rather than relying on dialectical logic — which seeks resolution through opposition — it employs what Thomas Docherty describes as the *politics of affirmation*. This process embraces multiplicity, coexistence, and the affirmation of difference as a means of creating new possibilities for understanding identity, agency, and historical continuity (*The Politics of Affirmation*, 2019).

## Technical Domains and the Politics of Affirmation

Building on this foundation, it becomes increasingly evident that political phenomena are deeply entrenched across all realms of human and nonhuman interaction, extending far beyond the visible structures of governance or formal social organization. Even in domains frequently perceived as neutral or objective — such as computer science, artificial intelligence research, and data science — there exists a substratum of embedded assumptions about instrumentality, anthropocentrism, identity, and agency.

Within this context, the politics of affirmation emerges as a critical praxis, urging us to confront, deconstruct, and rethink the biases, exclusions, and implicit hierarchies that remain obscured within technical and analytic frameworks. It actively reconfigures these domains, foregrounding multiplicity and relationality in spaces traditionally dominated by reductionist methodologies and universalist narratives.

For instance, an AI ethics board employing the politics of affirmation might prioritize transparency in algorithmic design, emphasizing systems that adaptively learn from marginalized perspectives. Such reflexive engagement transforms the systems we create into ethical co-creators, actively reshaping how collective futures are envisioned and operationalized.

## Becoming Minoritarian and Hybridity

This transformative outlook finds a parallel in Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s concept of *becoming minoritarian* (*A Thousand Plateaus*, 1987), which underscores the creative and political power of marginalized identities. By advancing the politics of affirmation, practitioners and theorists engage in a process akin to becoming minoritarian, rejecting majoritarian norms and values to embrace alternative ways of being and relating that resist universalizing tendencies.

Haraway’s *A Cyborg Manifesto* (1991) also radically reimagines identity as a hybrid assemblage:

> “A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction... The boundary between science fiction and social reality is an optical illusion.”

Through her critique, Haraway offered a radical rethinking of identity — one that refuses the neat separations between human, animal, and machine, and instead embraces overlapping, intermingling, and co-evolution.

---

## Intersectionality, Hybridity, and Assemblages

Haraway’s vision enriches intersectionality (coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw) by highlighting how hybridity not only crosses human-centered categories like race, gender, and class but also extends to the entanglements between humans, non-humans, and machines. Intersectionality, viewed through Haraway’s lens of hybridity, moves beyond human-centric categories to recognize that identities are formed in relation to broader assemblages that include ecological systems, technological networks, and cultural artifacts.

For example, environmental racism and the digital divide demonstrate how systemic inequalities are entangled with ecological and technological realities.

## Genealogy, Derrida, and Negative Augmentation

This reconfiguration of identity echoes the broader intellectual currents of poststructuralist and postmodernist thought, which emphasized that deconstruction had to come first — an interrogation of limiting assumptions to expose and unsettle foundational categories. Michel Foucault’s *genealogy* shows how the concept of “man” is a recent invention shaped by specific power structures. Derrida’s deconstruction — “there is nothing outside the text” — similarly dismantles rigid ontologies.

Negative augmentation, then, is a praxis of revealing: an intentional process of uncovering latent virtual possibilities within identity and thought by not just dismantling sedimented meaning but configuring static planes as generative potentials.

---

## Charting Affirmative Cartographies

This praxis is not merely destructive but constructive: it charts *affirmative cartographies* — expansive terrains of meaning and subjectivity that affirm difference and plurality rather than reinforcing static binaries or hegemonic frameworks. These maps are nomadic, evolving in response to the interplay of ideas, experiences, and contexts.

Through this nomadic actualization of the virtual, negative augmentation brings forth unrealized potentials — immanent possibilities embedded within identity, language, and culture — that have been buried under historical and ideological sedimentation.

---

## Closing: Releasing to Become

In the end, the praxis of revealing proposes that human progress is not solely found in what we construct but in what we learn to shed — our vulnerabilities, assumptions, and categorical limitations. By relinquishing the supposed self from these restrictive concepts, the groundwork for the posthumanist project is laid, clearing the way for a more fluid, expansive understanding of Being. In essence, knowledge and growth reside not only in what we build but in what we release, allowing us to perceive more clearly the core of understanding itself.
